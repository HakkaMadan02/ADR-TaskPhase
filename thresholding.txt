(x,y)
x is threshold
y is output

cv.THRESH_BINARY
if the pixel value is greater that the threshold value, the pixel gets converted to output value, otherwise it becomes (0), or black

cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV
pixel gets converted to 0 if above the threshold, otherwise the output

cv.THRESH_TRUNC
if the pixel is above threshold, it will come down to the threshold pixel. Otherwise, it will remain as it was before

cv.THRESH_TOZERO
if the pixel is above the threshold, it will remain as it was before. Otherwise it will be turned to black (0)

cv.THRESH_TOZERO_INV
if the pixel is above threshold, then it goes to black. Otherwise it will remain as it is
